      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Mana Ngano Martha Shecho. I am a 20yrs old Cameroonian student
        based in Cameroon. As an aspiring cloud engineer, I am passionate about
        diversity and inclusion in technology and education, particularly
        advocating for African women in fields like software and cloud
        engineering, AI, and data science.
